Coding is a mix of dopamine-inducing moments and frustrating challenges. What I adore about coding is the art of problem-solving and the perpetual learning it offers. The ability to build anything you imagine is incredibly empowering.

### Early Fascination with Computers

My journey into coding started with a deep fascination for computers, especially after getting my first one. Coding became my favorite subject in school, and I even remember writing HTML on a blackboard. Despite the interest, I didn't pursue coding seriously due to scarce resources. Instead, I delved into blogging about computer tricks on my website, [hacklover.com](#).

### Diversifying into Design and YouTube

Exploring various interests, I transitioned to designing and learned Photoshop. Inspired by a YouTuber named Ziovo, I created content on YouTube about Windows tips and tricks, eventually switching to unboxing tech products. I also offered services like creating YouTube thumbnails and video editing on Sony Vegas Pro.

### University and Rediscovering Passion

Enrolling in university for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications, I learned various languages but still felt unsatisfied. The COVID lockdown became a turning point, leading me to experiment with iOS App Development and later Python and Data Science. However, these pursuits didn't bring lasting happiness.

### Finding Passion in Web Development

Reflecting on my love for design, I discovered that web development, particularly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was the quickest way to code and showcase my creations. Focusing on these technologies, I embarked on a journey that led me to become a software engineer with one and a half years of experience in startups.

It's a marathon, not a sprint, and this is my journey of exploring what I love. Your path may differ, but the essence lies in learning and doing what you love, whether it's coding, design, or playing a sport.
